  <h2 class = "Headers">Aim of the Project</h2>
  <p class = "Info">The goal of the project is to mainstream UHFSA media team's organization and scheduling. My first year in Media Team I 
    noticed that within the Photography branch we struggled with communication in respect to who would be attending shooting certain events 
    mainly because of unclear advertising of events and the inability to properly communicate who is going to what. Within the Design branch 
    of Media Team coordinators and members mentioned that there were often failure to take on projects. Hence, I wanted to develop a website 
    for UHFSA Media that impliments a calendar that clearly shows who would be attending what events and who claimed certain projects.
