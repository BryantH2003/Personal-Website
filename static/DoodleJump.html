<h2 class = "Headers">Aim of the Project</h2>
<p class = "Info">The aim of the project was to learn the basics of developing a 2D game using the Unity Game Engine. I used 
  this video by <a href = "https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IUzI95mmbwA">BMo</a> as a guide and for instruction in order to 
  acheive this goal.

<h2 class = "Headers">Deeper Dive</h2>
<p class = "Info">This project implimented 4 components in the sample space of the project: Main Camera, Player, Platform, and Game Manager. 
  Within each component contained a script file using CSharp as the assembly language. 
</p>
<h3 class = "Smaller-Headers">Main Camera</h3>
<p class = "Info">The Main Camera is a fairly simple component since its main responsiblilty is to follow the player's character model so that 
  the character doesn't move off screen. The script tracks the player's y position on the screen so that the camera can only move up and not down 
  since if the character falls of the screen then the game ends.   
</p>
<h3 class = "Smaller-Headers">Player / Platforms</h3>
<p class = "Info">The process of creating the player object and the platforms are relatively similar in regards to their components. Both require the 
  Rigidbody 3D and Box Collider 3D component. The Box Collider componenet defines a border around the models so that when that border comes into contact 
  with another model's border they can interact instead of simply passing through one another. The RidgidBody 3D component in a sense defines the properties 
  of the model since without the componenet the model is simpley an image. Setting the RidgidBody 3D component to Bouncy material allows the Doodle Jump character 
  to have its signiture bouncy trait when it lands on the platforms. 
</p>
<h3 class = "Smaller-Headers">Game Manager</h3>
<p class = "Info">The Game Manager componet of the game keeps track of how many platforms are generated into the game. Which is currently set to 300.

<h2 class = "Headers">Running Into Problems</h2>
<p class = "Info">Most of the problems that I ran into while working on this project was during the CSharp portion of the program when scripting what actual processes 
  of the game.
</p>
<hr class = "hr1">
<h2 class = "Headers">Tackling The Problems</h2>
<p class = "Info">Most of the problems would be syntax problems since the video was crammed into a 5 minute tutotial. I often had to look up CSharp functions and syntax 
  in order to solve the errors.
