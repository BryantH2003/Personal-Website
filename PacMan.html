<h2 class = "Headers">Aim of the Project</h2>
<p class = "Info">The goal was to not only create a replica of the famous Pac-Man game using my knowledge and help from 
    this YouTube tutorial series by <a href = "https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZdwRcte00oU&t=713s">A Plus Coding</a> but 
    try to also add unique aspects to the game itself.
</p>

<h2 class = "Headers">Deeper Dive</h2>
<p class = "Info">This project implimented the Pygame library and required multiple different files and classes to interwine. The project 
    was broken up into 3 classes. The App, Player, and Enemy classes. The program read from a text file called walls.txt and settings.py 
    in order to properly set varibles like generating the walls of the classic Pac-Man map and setting the speeds and colors of the character 
    models.
</p>
<h3 class = "Smaller-Headers">App Class</h3>
<p class = "Info">The App class is resposnsible for managing the different game states such as start and playing states. In the start state the 
    class uses the user defined start_draw() function to create the main menu page. This page prompts the player the Press Any Key To Start while idling
     in the start phase. Once any button is pushed the class is then updated to the playing state which calls a new set of functions to draw the Pac-Man map 
     and to constantly update the player's position. Within the App class both the little coins/tokens Pac-Man eats and the enemies objects are created using 
     empty lists and appending items to that list. For the tokens/coins, a function reads from the walls.txt file containings C for coin, 1 for a wall, and other 
     numbers greater than 1 for mark the positions of instantiation for the enemies. Everytime the file reads a C, a certain x and y coordinate is appended to the 
     list to create the loctions of coins/tokens, similarly to the walls.    
</p>
<h3 class = "Smaller-Headers">Enemies Class</h3>
<p class = "Info">The Enemies Class is resposnsible for instantiating the ghosts or enemies in the Pac-Man game. This class sets the personalities of the differnet 
    ghosts to random, slow, scared, or speedy to coincide with the personalities of the ghosts in the actual game. The random ghost moves in random direction by generating 
    a random number and using if statements as test cases for the four different possible directions of movement. The slow ghost has its speed set slower than the others. 
    The speedy ghost has its speed amped faster than the other ghosts and the scared ghost moves away from the player's character model.  
</p>
<h3 class = "Smaller-Headers">Player Class</h3>
<p class = "Info">The Player class creates the player character model and constantly updates the player's position. Here the score is also kept track by determining the player's 
    position and comparing it to the positions of the tokens/coins and then removing the tokens/coins from the background if the player has moved over it. The main functionality 
    of the player class are the functions that keep track of the player's position play area and determining how it will move next. Basically the play area is divided into even 
    grid boxes. Then based on those grid boxes the player's position is then shifted based on the width and height of the grid boxes.

<h3 class = "Headers">Running Into Problems</h3>
<p class = "Info">Problems that I ran into during the process of creating the Pac-Man replica was that since the videos were a bit outdated, the pygame library had been updated meaning 
    the way the video had used some of the functions did not coincide with the proper way to use it at the time I was coding. 
</p>
<h3 class = "Headers">Tackling The Problems</h3>
<p class = "Info">I had to use the <a href = "https://www.pygame.org/docs/">Pygame Library Website</a> to learn some of the functions I was useing in order to properly impliment them. I 
    often had to play around with the functions before I could add them into my project.
